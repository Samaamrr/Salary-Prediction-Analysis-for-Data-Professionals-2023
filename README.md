# Salary-Prediction-Analysis-for-Data-Professionals-2023

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting salaries for data professionals. By examining various features such as experience level, job title, company size, and employment type, the goal is to uncover salary trends and develop a predictive model to estimate salaries based on these inputs.

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Analyze the distribution of salaries and associated features.
   - Identify patterns or correlations between variables and salary.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the dataset by addressing duplicates, missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implement and evaluate various machine learning models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

4. **Insights and Visualization**:
   - Generate visualizations to highlight key findings, including salary distributions and the influence of experience on compensation.
   - Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.
